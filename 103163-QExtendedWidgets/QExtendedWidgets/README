    QExtendedWidgets 1.0
*************************************

* QExtendedGridView : is a piece of software I use extensively in my daliy job.
  I think could be useful for other, so I decided to publish it.

  It's written in C++ and based on Qt 4.5

  It's designed to improve the behaviour of QT's QTreeView, allowing you to do
  some things Qt forgot to implement :

    - Logically Group columns into several bands.
    - Have footers in sync with headers for every colum
    - Lock leftmost "N" columns while scrolling the remaining
    - And all of this with a simple QAbstractItemView model

* QExtendedTabWidget : an extension of QTabWidget, allowing to show / hide tabs. 
  When re-showing a tab it remembers where it was.

INSTALLING QExtendedWidgets 1.0
*************************************

It's simple. First extract the source package :

untar/unzip QExtendedWidgets.tar.gz

Compile & link it with your code and use it instead of QTreeView / QTabWidget

NOTE :

- QExtendedGridView is not a complete replacement, but only a subset of
  QTreeView. If you need some more functionality, you can expand it as you want.

- You need the appropriate Qt4 package installed on your system.

*************************************
    DEMO
*************************************

cd Test
qmake
and then
make (or nmake under Windows)

NOTE : I simply touched a little bit Qt's Simple Tree Model demo to show how
QExtendedGridView works. So, many thanks to the trolls. And I think 
QExtendedTabWidget doesn't need explanation of its use...

*************************************
    HOW-TO USE
*************************************

* QExtendedGridView :

To populate Header, bands & footer I use a proxy model, so you ONLY have to
reimplement headerData method from QAbstractItemView having in mid :

- Section -1 to -N are requests to footer data. To know wich section, you have to
  calculate newSection = - section -1 and answer a correct info depending on role.

- To populate header band's roles , QExtendedGridVeiw adds Qt::UserRole to to role
  requested, so  you will receive a Qt::UserRole + Qt::BackgroundRole instead of
  Qt::BackgroundRole in bands requests.

And no more, look at the sources to know the interface, it's easy & simple to work with this.

* QExtendedTabWidget :

Replace any QTabWidget you have and you can hide / show tabs easily

*************************************
  SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
*************************************

QExtendedGridView supports all of platforms that Qt4.5 does.

At least Windows / Linux ( where it's tested, but there is no reason not to work
on Mac... )

Have fun !!
