"Thetyss Data Browser" description:
Project "Thetyss Data Browser" started in July,  2007. The purpose of the project is to work out a fast and flexible data browser with low bandwith also on BIG SQL tables. 

Feature list:
- Qt4
- Reducing number of rows by typing filter text
- Filters can be setup for certain columns
- Coloring background and fonts of rows according to SVG color codes
- Column sorting: incresing / decreasing / not sorted
- Extra low data bandwith: with demo database (with 1.3 million record) ca. 16KB  data traffic by starting and ca. 4 kB by further searching.
- Specially worked out for Postgres: Data Browser works with two different query modes. To 1000. row uses offset-limit, above cursor.
- The speed of data browsing and data filtering processes depend only on Postgres table structures and Postgres query optimalizations. 
- Saving current view.
- Use and saving of multiple views with filters. By saving users can be differentiated
- Use of optional aggregators in the last row: Sum(), Count(), Avg(), Min(), Max()
- Printing current view
- Print preview
- The printing process fetches only the necessary data
- PDF export
- CSV export
- It can be used as designer plugin.

Install demo:

1) Change Postgres parameters in datazoom/demo/dialog.cpp

2)  Change Postgres parameters in datazoom/sql/new-test.sh
    For windows Users: import test.sql into Postgres database

3) Type in project root directory
   qmake
   make
